# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset. The purpose is to uncover insights, detect patterns, and perform data preprocessing before building a predictive model.

## Features
- Data loading and cleaning
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Feature engineering
- Data visualization for trends, relationships, and distributions
- Insights into customer behavior and product performance

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code and visualizations

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following tools installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

## Key Insights
  -Initial data exploration and feature engineering were performed to prepare the data for further modeling.
  -Key trends and patterns are visualized to derive business insights.
## Future Work
This project can be extended to:

  -Build predictive models based on the insights derived from the EDA process.
  -Deploy the model using cloud services.
